      <h1>Heritage rooted in Sabi Gold Mine</h1>
      <p>
        From the first pegged claims in 1890 to the present-day ANMACK MINING partnership,
        Sabi Gold Mine has continuously adapted, retooled, and invested in Zimbabwe’s mining future.

        <h2>Resilience through the decades</h2>
        <p>
          The mine’s production first surged in 1909. After joining the Zimbabwe Mining Development
          Corporation portfolio, Sabi Gold experienced both celebrated milestones and demanding
          restarts, culminating in its 2017 relaunch under judicial management.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, a strategic alliance with Chandiwana Mining Corporation ushered in the ANMACK MINING
          (Pvt) Ltd era, combining world-class technical know-how, stringent governance, and capital
          reinvestment to revitalise the Midlands Province operation.
